# European-Gender-Equality-Index

This repository contains the source code associated with the project described in the paper "*Enhancing the Understanding of the EU Gender Equality Index Through Spatiotemporal Visualizations*". The main objective of this project is to increase the understanding of the index with spatiotemporal visualizations such as cartograms, heatmaps, and choropleth maps and some strategies focusing on analyzing the evolution of the countries over the years in an open-access environment. 

The visualizations are made using the data from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) available [here](https://eige.europa.eu/gender-equality-index/2022). Therefore, the application may be used as an addition to the EIGE web.
